# Rapid Generator

## Installation

### Yeoman

First, you need to install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io). You only have to ask for her once, then she packs up and moves into your hard drive.

Open up your terminal, and in any directory, run:
```
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generator

Yeoman travels light. She didn't pack any generators when she moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in, and like Yeoman herself, you only have to ask for generators once. This project is all about the Rapid Design System, so letâ€™s grab that generator.

To install generator-rapid with npm, run:
```
npm install -g generator-rapid
```

Then, run Yeoman to build a new project:
```
yo rapid
```
