# Welcome to {{ title }}

Welcome to {{ title }}: A starter environment for prototyping with Rapid Design System. Build pages in the `pages` folder, and create templates in the `templates` folder. This project comes with the Rapid SCSS library, but you're free to write your own SCSS in the `sass` folder.  

Pages can be writen in HTML and compiled via [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), which allows for templating and supports frontmatter.  

Pages can also be written in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) using the GitHub Flavored Markdown style.
